# pranis-main

This is the repo for my personal website.

I wanted to try out a static site generator that has a lot of flexibility, while avoiding having dozens of features I'd never use. 11ty seemed to work just fine for this (okay, probably still a bit overkill for a basic personal site, but really I just wanted to experiment with it). For everything else, I just use bare javascript, and html templates.

For hosting I use Netlify and Decap CMS.
